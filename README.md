# Drum-Kit-Project
Built an interactive drum kit web app where users can play sounds via mouse clicks or keyboard keys using vanilla JavaScript, CSS and DOM events. 
Implemented audio playback, keypress listeners, and simple animations to improve user experience and practice event handling in the browser.
